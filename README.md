# Itadakimasu!

## Introduction
Food is the most important part of travel.

Why is that? Preparing ordering food at home is routine. It's expected. But hop on a plane, and suddenly, acquiring food is a challenge. If you don't know the magic words, you're out of luck. You resort to pointing wildly at the menu, unaware of what dish will reach your table.

If you're planning a trip to Japan, or want to learn Japanese, Itadakimasu will help you learn the names of common Japanese foods. Impress friends, waiters, and friends-who-are-also-waiters with your knowledge. Good luck, gourmand.

## What is spaced repetition?
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that has found mainstream success in a wide variety of learning applications. This technique is perfect for language learning, which requires students to learn a large number of items and retain them indefinitely in memory. As you encounter pieces of information more and more, the less often you need to refresh your memory of it.
